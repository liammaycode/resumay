                <p class="content-subtitle">Senior Design Project - completed 2021</p>
                <p class="content">The Democracy Token project was team effort by myself and four other University of Central Florida seniors to create a transparent and accurate election platform. We were able to ensure that only those who were allowed to vote in an election could vote, everyone had only one vote, and real-time election results were viewable to anyone with access to a web browser. We did this by storing election information on the Ethereum blockchain and creating unique and disposable wallet ids for election participants. I was lucky to have such talented team members whom I could develop my skills alongside of. </p>

                <p class="content">At UCF I was sure to attend as many HackUCF meetings and coding team practices as I could. My electives taught me about networking and security with a little UI/UX for fun. I made friends and started my coding journey here. Although I feel my time at UCF was made more difficult due to Covid restrictions, I am grateful for the plethora of resources, mentors, and peers that were afforded to me. I believe that momentum I gained at UCF still carries me today towards mastering my craft.</p>
